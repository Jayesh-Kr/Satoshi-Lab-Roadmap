# Cyber Security

***[Click me first](AS6380756171694101529140490119_content_1.pdf)***

Apart from the prerequisites mentioned in the main readme, Cyber Security as a domain requires a few more fundamental concepts and topics to be covered. An exhaustive introduction can be found in [Cisco Networking Academy's Introduction to Cyber Security](https://www.netacad.com/courses/security/cybersecurity-essentials), and in [SANS Cyber Aces Online Tutorial](https://tutorials.cyberaces.org/tutorials.html).  

Before you go ahead and dive into any of the fields below, play a few CTFs ([WTF is CTF?](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/)) to practice and hone your basic skills. A good start would be the [picoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) followed by [OverTheWire's wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)!

## Binary Exploitation

Here's a [CTF-themed overview](https://ctf101.org/binary-exploitation/overview/) of Binary Exploitation and all it's concepts. Being a very vast and vaguely defined topic, it is essential to know the techniques and tools before the theory to properly form an outlook. Don't be scared if you can't do this, it's one of the most difficult yet the most sought-after expertise in Cyber Security!
